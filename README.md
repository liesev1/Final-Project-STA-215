**Demographics in the United States House of Representatives**
This is my final project for STA-215 where I completed an analysis of the United States House of Representatives using various statistics. I collected data on the race, gender, party, age, education, term, previous job, wealth, christian affiliation, abortion stance, gun policy, voting record, bills passed, and region for each of the 435 members in the House.

**Instructions**
To utilize the script, open the "Liese Final Project Script .R" file that contains my code for the tables and graphs constructed using the "dataset.csv".

**Data**
The data collected for this analysis was all individually collected for each of the 435 representatives on the topics listed above. 

The data was gathered based on records that are available to the public.
