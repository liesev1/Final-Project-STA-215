# Demographics in the United States House of Representatives
This is my final project for STA-215 where I completed an analysis of the United States House of Representatives using various statistics. I collected data on race, gender, party, age, education, term, previous job, wealth, christian affiliation, abortion stance, gun policy, voting record, bills passed, and region for all 435 members in the House. 

# Instructions
To utilize the script, open the "Liese Final Project Script .R" file that contains my code for the tables and graphs constructed using "dataset.csv".

# Data
The data collected for this analysis was collected for each of the 435 representatives on the topics listed above. Our goal was to learn more about the demographics in the house, and analyze the relationship between different variables. 

Our data was gathered based on online records available to the public. All sources were analyzed for credibility prior to data collection.
